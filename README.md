# Miniproject 2

### [Assignment](assignment.md)

## Project/Goals
Using multiple API's (FourSquare and Yelp) to pull bar data from my surronding area, combining the API data into 1 database that shows the ratings pulled from each API.

## Process
### (your step 1)
### (your step 2)

## Results
FourSquare had far less coverage of my specific area.  Returning only 47 of the 50 requests as well as having many of the returned values be missing a rating.  Yelp on the other hand satisfied
